# Overview

Dapps are an exiting way to showcase a contract or a series of contracts with a simple interface that allows users to interact with it in a secure way. This guide will provide a step-by-step guide for developers to develop dapps for their contracts and integrate these into Parity.

Parity supports 2 types of dapps - one locally hosted (ideal for dapps still in development, or those dapps that are private) and network dapps (ideal for dapps applicable to a global community.) 


## Local Dapps

Local dapps allows the developer to get comfortable with the required interfaces, structure and requirements of dapps before making it available to the global community. As such any dapps deployed locally (either tied to the live or test network - or both), it only available on the local machine. This typically would be the first step to developing a dapp, once satisfied, the developer can move the dapp to the network if so required.
