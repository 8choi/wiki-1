title: Parity Substrate
---

Next-generation framework for blockchain innovation.

At its heart, Substrate is a combination of three technologies: WebAssembly, Libp2p and AfG Consensus. It is both a library for building new blockchains and a "skeleton key" of a blockchain client, able to synchronize to any Substrate-based chain.

Substrate chains have three distinct features that make them "next-generation": a dynamic, self-defining state-transition function (STF), light-client functionality from day one and a progressive consensus algorithm with fast block production and adaptive, definite finality.

The STF, encoded in WebAssembly, is known as the "runtime". This defines the execute_block function and can specify everything from the staking algorithm, transaction semantics, logging mechanisms and procedures for replacing any aspect of itself or of the blockchainâ€™s state ("governance"). Because the runtime is entirely dynamic all of these can be switched out or upgraded at any time. A Substrate chain is very much a "living organism".
