## DAO Structure

- Code may be changed by 90% of voter support. 
- DAO has a number of voting tokens
  - DAO voting tokens float freely.
  - DAO may elect to issue additional voting tokens.

- Initial code:
  - Ethcore begins as chair.
  - Every month, chair proposes four ways of spending funds (given as message calls) plus a fifth "something else".
  - Voting lasts one week.
  - All voters may vote for any combination of these.
  - The option with the highest number of votes is executed.
  - After 2 "something else"s winning, the fifth option becomes instead "change chair".
  - If change chair wins, there is a week-long period where voters can vote for candidate chairs; the winning candidate is installed as chair.
