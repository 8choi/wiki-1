If you want to serve a [[Parity Wallet]] to multiple private or public devices it's worth to consider running a **Public Node** rather then whitelisting hosts for user and websockets interfaces. To start a public node, simply run:

```bash
parity --public-node
```

This will publicly expose the Parity Wallet on port :8180 of your node and can be reached by anyone with access to the public IP or domain. An example public node is served on [wallet.parity.io](https://wallet.parity.io/), see also [[Wallet.Parity.Io]].
