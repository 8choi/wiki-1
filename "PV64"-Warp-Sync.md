# Warp Sync

Warp Sync is the next version of the Ethereum Wire protocol, which involves sending snapshots over the network to get the full state at a given block extremely quickly, and then filling in the blocks between the genesis and the snapshot in the background.

Documentation on the snapshot format can be found here: https://github.com/ethcore/parity/wiki/%22PV64%22-Snapshot-Format
