Parity comes bundled with a number of consensus engines. While the most widely used is the `Ethash` proof of work `Engine`, there are others which can be used for proof of authority or stake chains.
The `Engine` is chosen by placing an appropriate entry in the `"engine"` field of the spec and providing the correct `"seal"` under `"genesis"` field, as described on the [[Chain specification]] page.

## Ethash

[Original Ethereum PoW](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash) `Engine`.

```json
"engine": {
	"Ethash": {
		"params": {
			"gasLimitBoundDivisor": "0x0400",
			"minimumDifficulty": "0x020000",
			"difficultyBoundDivisor": "0x0800",
			"durationLimit": "0x0d",
			"blockReward": "0x4563918244F40000",
			"registrar": "0x81a4b044831c4f12ba601adb9274516939e9b8a2",
			"homesteadTransition": 0,
			"eip150Transition": 0,
			"eip155Transition": 10,
			"eip160Transition": 10,
			"eip161abcTransition": 10,
			"eip161dTransition": 10,
			"maxCodeSize": 24576
		}
	}
}
```

The `"params"` object for `"Ethash"` may contain the following keys (YP refers to the Yellow Paper equation numbers):
- `"gasLimitBoundDivisor"` influences how rapidly is the gas limit allowed to evolve, redefines the value in (YP:45â€“46), originally 1024 = `0x400`
- `"minimumDifficulty"` is self-explanatory, redefines the value of `D_0` in the latter two lines of (YP:39)
- `"difficultyBoundDivisor"` influences how rapidly is the difficulty evolving, redefines the value in (YP:41), originally 2048 = `0x800`
- `"durationLimit"` is the equilibrium block interval for the pre-Homestead era difficulty evolution, irrelevant for block numbers above `homesteadTransition`, redefines the value in (YP:42), originally 13 = `0xd`
- `"difficultyIncrementDivisor"` is related to the equilibrium block intervals for the Homestead era difficulty evolution, redefines the value in (YP:43), originally 10 = `0xa`
- `"homesteadTransition"` is `N_H` of (YP:13, 39) etc., or the block number after which the second line of (YP:39) is superseded by the third line, changing the difficulty evolution function
- `"blockReward"` specifies the reward in wei given for authoring a block

```json
"seal": {
	"ethereum": {
		"nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
		"mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
	}
}
```

## Instant Seal

`Engine` which can be used for development, as described in [[Private development chain]].

```json
"engine": {
	"instantSeal": null
}
```

```json
"seal": {
	"generic": "0x0"
}
```

This `Engine` does not have any parameters to be adjusted.

# Validator engines

The following `Engine`s achieve consensus by referring to a list of "validators" (referred to as authorities, when they are linked to physical entities). Validators are a group of accounts which are allowed to participate in the consensus, they validate the transactions and blocks to later sign messages about them.

They can be either specified at genesis using a simple `"list"` (as shown in the Authority Round and Tendermint sections):
```json
"validators": {
	"list": [
		"0x7d577a597b2742b498cb5cf0c26cdcd726d39e6e",
		"0x82a978b3f5962a5b0957d9ee9eef472ee55b42f1"
	]
}
```

The list can be also part of the blockchain state by being stored in an Ethereum contract. The contract has to have the following interface:
```json
{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"getValidators","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"address[]"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"}
```
The function `getValidators` will be called on every block to determine the current list. The switching rules are then determined by the contract implementing that method. The spec should contain the contract address:
```json
"validators": {
	"safeContract": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000005"
}
```
Example contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/ethcore/contracts/tree/master/validator_contracts). It is best to include the contract in the genesis (placing it in the `"accounts"` field).

## Authority Round

A PoW inspired consensus algorithm, each validator gets an assigned time slot in which they can release a block. The time slots are determined by the system clock of each validator.

```json
"engine": {
    "authorityRound": {
        "params": {
            "gasLimitBoundDivisor": "0x400",
            "stepDuration": "5",
            "validators" : {
                "list": [
                    "0x37f93cfe411fa244b87ff257085ee360fca245e8",
                    "0x610a3a37b98bf0c91c35442e489c246096739324"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`"gasLimitBoundDivisor"` determines how fast the gas limit should adjust, most of the time `0x400` is fine  
`"stepDuration"` determines the lowest interval between blocks in seconds, too low might cause reorgs if the system clocks are not synchronized, too high leads to slow block issuance  
`"validators"` is the list of addresses of the entities which will be allowed to issue blocks  
Optional:  
`"blockReward"` determines the reward given to issuing authority  

```json
"seal": {
    "authorityRound": {
        "step": "0x0",
        "signature": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    }
}
```

The genesis seal should not be changed unless a hard fork is conducted.

If malicious authorities are possible then --force-sealing is advised, this will ensure that the correct chain is the longest (making it BFT with finality of authorities_count * step_duration given no network partitions).

## Tendermint

This consensus is still experimental, please use Authority Round for more stable solution.

```json
"engine": {
    "tendermint": {
        "params": {
            "gasLimitBoundDivisor": "0x400",
            "validators" : {
                "list": [
                    "0x37f93cfe411fa244b87ff257085ee360fca245e8",
                    "0x610a3a37b98bf0c91c35442e489c246096739324"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`"gasLimitBoundDivisor"` determines how fast the gas limit should adjust, most of the time `0x400` is fine  
`"validators"` is the list of addresses of the entities which will be allowed to issue blocks  
Optional:  
`"blockReward"` determines the reward given to issuing authority  
`"timeoutPropose"`  
`"timeoutPrevote"`  
`"timeoutPrecommit"`  
`"timeoutCommit"`  

```json
"seal": {
    "tendermint": {
        "round": "0x0",
        "proposal": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "precommits": [
            "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        ]
    }
}
```

The genesis seal should not be changed unless a hard fork is conducted.
