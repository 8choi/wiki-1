Parity comes bundled with a number of consensus engines. While the most widely used is the `Ethash` proof of work `Engine`, there are others which can be used for proof of authority or stake chains.
The `Engine` is chosen by placing an appropriate entry in the `"engine"` field of the spec and providing the correct `"seal"` under `"genesis"` field, as described on the [[Chain specification]] page.

## Ethash

## Instant Seal

## Authority Round
