# Parity

Parity is an Ethereum client, written from the ground-up for correctness-verifiability, modularisation, low-footprint and high-performance. To this end it utilises the Rust language, a hybrid imperative/OO/functional language with an emphasis on efficiency. It is professionally developed by Ethcore; we aim to have all important logic 100% unit-tested, all public APIs 100% documented and follow a pipelined 6-week release cycle similar to rustc.
