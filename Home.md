# Parity

Parity is an Ethereum client, written from the ground-up for correctness-verifiability, modularisation, low-footprint and high-performance. To this end it utilises the Rust language, a hybrid imperative/OO/functional language with an emphasis on efficiency. It is professionally developed by Ethcore; we aim to have all important logic 100% unit-tested, all public APIs 100% documented and follow a pipelined 6-ish-week release cycle similar to the Rust compiler.

If you want to get a node up and running with Parity, see the [[Quick-start]] guide. If you're interested in mining with Parity, see the [[Mining]] guide. If you'd like to use the Web3 Javascript interface with Parity, see the [[Developers]] guide. If you're interested in hacking on the Parity code base see the [[Coding-guide]].
