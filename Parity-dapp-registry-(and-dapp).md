# Overview

The Parity UI uses an [underlying contract](https://github.com/ethcore/contracts/blob/master/DappReg.sol) to lookup and display dapps that have been registered on the network. Currently the contract does not have a dapp/UI, however it is available for both [Homestead (code & ABI)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD70994d7020DF8052A1124561ff548f3b88744d8#code) and [Morden](https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x11e869F9094a1101B4C60201d6Cf894AfC7EadBB).

**WARNING** There is a non-refundable fee associated with registering a dapp. Dropping a dapp will not return this fee. So only interact with the dapp and contract if you are certain you know what you are doing and understand the risks.

## Reserving a dapp

Execute the `register(_id: bytes32)` function on the contract with a unique id (once a dapp/UI is available this would probably be the sha3 of the name or a unique generated id) - the id could be as simple as the content hash for the initial dapp code (as generated by the [Github Hint Dapp](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/wiki/Parity-github-hint-(and-dapp)))

Ensure that the required fee (currently 1 ETH) is paid and that the owner address is the address you wish to use to update associated meta data.

Once registered, the id field in the manifest should be updated to reflect this new id.

## Adding metadata

Set the metadata for the registered dapp with the `setMeta(_id: bytes32, _key: bytes32, _value: bytes32)` function on the contract. In each case -

- `_id` is the same id your reserved when registering the dapp above
- `_key` is the metadata key (more on this below)
- `_value` is the actual metadata value, typically a content hash as registered via the github hint dapp

Currently available metadata keys are the following -

- `content` - `0x434f4e54454e54` (`CONTENT` hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp content bundle
- `manifest` - `0x4d414e4946455354` (`MANIFEST` hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp `manifest.json`
- `image` - `0x494d47` (`IMG` hex-encoded), pointing to the dapp logo
