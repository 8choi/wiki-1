Parity supports private chain and private network configuration via [[Chain specification]] files provided with `--chain`. In addition to the usual [proof of work chains](PoW chains), Parity also includes [proof of authority chain](PoA chains) consensus, which does not require mining.
More details on the available options can be found on the [[Consensus Engines]] page.
