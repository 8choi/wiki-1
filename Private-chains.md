Parity supports private chain and private network configuration via [[Chain specification]] files provided with `--chain`. In addition to the usual [[Proof of Work Chains]], Parity also includes [[Proof of Authority Chains]] which do not require mining.
More details on the available options can be found on the [[Consensus Engines]] page.
